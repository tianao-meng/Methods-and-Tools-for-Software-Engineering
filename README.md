Security Cameras Installations Plan (Vertex Cover Problem)
•	Write python script to parse graph input and implement BFS to find shortest path using C++.
•	Achieve multi-process calling fork() and inter-process communication calling pipe(), dup2() to connect python script to C++ file.
•	Implement different algorithms to solve vertex cover problem in a multi-thread way and compare the running time and accuracy.
